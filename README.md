# Amazon Stock Forecasting Using LSTM and PyTorch
This project implements a time-series analysis pipeline to forecast Amazon stock prices using LSTM neural networks in PyTorch. The steps include:

- Preprocessing stock price data (from AMZN.csv) and preparing it for LSTM modeling.
- Defining and training a neural network to predict stock prices.
- Visualizing predictions and evaluating model performance.
